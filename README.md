- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
    - A neural network schema to act as an abstraction engine in artifical information systems.
    - The Virtual Cell Competition (please reach out to me with any questions here).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning information theory to explore frontier RL systems and dynamical systems to explore the virtual cell. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research around increasing neural network effiency particulary in biology and reinforcement learning with world modeling.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all of the above
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my love of climbing or Go (the board game)
